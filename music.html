          <li>Arrangement includes Acoustic, Cajon, Vocals, and overdubbed Electric</li>
          <li>This track was written and recorded within a few hours on some Sunday afternoon</li>
          <li>The recording was finally mixed a few weeks later on an equally beautiful Sunday afternoon</li>

        <ul class="songdesc">
          <li>Arrangement includes Acoustic, Bass, Drums, Vox, Synth, and a field recording</li>
          <li>The intention for this track was to make it sound pure, so the recordings are not doctored much</li>
          <li>Because of this, the mix did not feel very full, so we ended up recording sounds from outside and placed them at the beginning and end of the track</li>
          <li>The airy synth towards the end of the track is a Casio CZ-3000 doused in reverb</li>

          <li>Arrangement includes Acoustic and Vocals</li>
          <li>This was an improvisational piece by a friend and me</li>
          <li>The acoustic recording suffers from some noticeable string buzz at the beginning, but due to the nature of the recording I felt it wasnâ€™t worth it to overdub</li>
          <li>The vocals are run through two compressors in series, one to handle the transient attack, and another to normalize the volume of the track throughout</li>

        <ul class="songdesc">
          <li>Arrangement includes Acoustic, Electric, Bass, Drums, and Vox</li>
          <li>The reverberated guitar builds a padding at the back of the mix, while the other guitar parts add interesting twinkles in the separate channels</li>
          <li>The bassline is one of the driving elements of the track, so it sits higher up in the mix</li>
          <li>The vocals are double tracked and hard panned, since I did not think the vocals were powerful enough to stand on their own</li>
